# Matplotlib Exercises

Welcome to the Matplotlib exercises! These exercises are designed to help you practice and understand Matplotlib, a powerful visualization library in Python. 

You'll start with some basic plotting and gradually move to more complex plots. These exercises will help solidify your understanding of Matplotlib, making it easier to create visualizations for your data analysis tasks.

By the end of these exercises, you should feel more comfortable using Matplotlib for your data visualization needs.

## Exercises Overview

1. **Basic Plotting:** Creating simple line plots and setting labels and titles.
2. **Multiple Plots:** Creating figures with multiple plots and customizing their layouts.
3. **Inset Plots:** Adding inset plots within a main plot and adjusting their axis limits.
4. **Subplots:** Creating subplots and adjusting their size and appearance.

**NOTE: ALL THE COMMANDS FOR PLOTTING A FIGURE SHOULD GO IN THE SAME CELL. SEPARATING THEM OUT INTO MULTIPLE CELLS MAY CAUSE NOTHING TO SHOW UP. REFER THE NOTEBOOK FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
## Data

We will use the following data for all exercises:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.arange(0, 100)
y = x * 2
z = x ** 2
